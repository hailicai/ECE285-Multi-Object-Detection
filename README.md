* Keras 2.x
* OpenCV
* Python3.x
* Numpy
* Beautiful Soup 4.x

All can be installed using Anaconda

Code Organization:
=================
1. Run Demo.ipynb for fast visualizing the prediction difference when fine-tunning with more birds data.
2. Run different modification of interest following the descriptions in the report.
